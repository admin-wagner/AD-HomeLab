<h2>Installing RAS / NAT</h2>
<li>Why? Because our client machine will not be accessing the internet directly, but instead use the server's connection</li>
<li>so in order for the client machine to get an ip address assigned to use the internet with, you need to install NAT (Network Address Translation) on the server</li>
<li>and install RAS (Remote Access Service)</li>
