<li>Group Policy Objects allow us to define permissions that our users may or may not have to access certain functions, files, folders, etc</li>
<li>They also let us define configurations that are set up on certain machines such as:</li>
  &emsp;<li>   setting up printer connections</li>
 &emsp; <li>  default wallpapers</li>
 &emsp; <li>  running scripts on first boot</li>
  &emsp;<li>  and lots more</li>
